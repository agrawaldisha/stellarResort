The main method serves as the entry point of the application, providing a CLI-based interface for users to interact with the PayFast app.
It presents the user with options to view their profile, check balance, make payments, and pay bills.
Service Layer

The service layer contains the business logic for processing user requests, such as retrieving user details, processing payments, and managing bill payments.
It interacts with the repository layer to perform CRUD operations on the database.
Repository Layer

The repository layer manages the database interactions using JDBC or an ORM like Hibernate.
It handles queries for retrieving user details, balance information, and performing updates for payments and bill transactions.
Database (DB)

The database is managed using PostgreSQL and pgAdmin.
It stores user profiles, account balances, transaction histories, and biller information.
